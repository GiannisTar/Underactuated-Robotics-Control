# Underactuated-Robotics-Control

Modeled and simulated the classical underactuated robotic system of the inverted pendulum-cart. Explored, implemented and demonstrated two non-linear controllers (Energy based Swing-up, SMC), alongside the uncontrolled and linearly controlled case (LQR), with the aim of successfully stabilizing the pendulum in the upright position.
